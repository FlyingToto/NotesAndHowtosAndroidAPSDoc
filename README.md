# howtodocument

Here I will document the tools I use to  work on the AndroidAPS documentation.
 
## operating system
I use **Manjaro Linux 21.2.5**. It's not important but there the tools are available und work very well.

## Github
I use **Github Desktop** to handle the communication with Github.

I used the AppImage to set it up and had to install gnome-keyring manually to get it working.

Afterwords it runs very well and I have a good tool to handle the Github changes.

It's important to alwas start a branch for the work and then bring it later with a PR into the main branch.
The temporary branch can then be deleted. Maybe there is better solution later with merge a branch into another but I don't know it at the moment for sure. This way it works. ;-)

## md/rst-Editor
For editing md/rst-files I use the simple tool **ReText** which can handle both formats.

You can switch to a double view with preview on the right by using the key combinatation CTRL-L.

## Screenshot-Tool
I use **ksnip** for makeing screenshots and comment them directly in the tool.

The comment functionaltity is very good.

## Resizing of Images
I use **Gwenview** for resizing the images.
